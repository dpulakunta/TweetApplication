TweetApplication
================
This is an example of rest client API app. Here we do OAuth authenication and connect to Twitter and see the twitter timeline
and also add new tweets to the timeline.

User Stories Completed:
-----------------------
User can sign in to Twitter using OAuth login
User can view the tweets from their home timeline
User should be able to see the username, name, body and timestamp for each tweet
User should be displayed the relative timestamp for a tweet "8m", "7h"
User can view more tweets as they scroll with infinite pagination

User can compose a new tweet
User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
User is taken back to home timeline with new tweet visible in timeline
Optional: User can see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet


I have added a gif file to show the working of the App.
